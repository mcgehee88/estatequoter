  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section class="pro-section" id="pro-how">
    <h2>How it works for your business</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of texting back and forth for weeks, you send one link. The client fills it out, EstateQuoter applies your rules, and you decide what to take and what to pass on.
    </p>

      <article class="pro-how-card">
        <div class="pro-how-step">Step 1</div>
        <h3>Set your rules once</h3>
        <p>
          Tell EstateQuoter how you price jobs, what size homes you accept, what areas you cover, and which jobs are an automatic no. You control your own margin.

        <div class="pro-how-step">Step 2</div>

    <h2>Questions pros ask before they sign up</h2>

    <div class="pro-faq-item">
      <div class="pro-faq-question">Is this replacing my website?</div>
      <div class="pro-faq-answer">
        No. EstateQuoter sits next to your website. You can link to it from your site, social profiles, email signature, and referral partners so every job starts in the same clean intake flow.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-faq-item">
      <div class="pro-faq-question">Do you send me new clients or just organize my leads?</div>
      <div class="pro-faq-answer">
        Both. Every plan gives you a private intake link for your own leads. Paid plans can also appear in the EstateQuoter directory so families can discover you directly when they request quotes.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-faq-item">
      <div class="pro-faq-question">Can I control what kinds of jobs I see?</div>
      <div class="pro-faq-answer">
        Yes. You set your service area, home size ranges, timing, and other filters so you spend less time on jobs that are too small, too far away, or not a fit.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pro-faq-item">
      <div class="pro-faq-question">What happens after someone fills out my form?</div>
      <div class="pro-faq-answer">
        You receive a structured summary by email, and in paid plans it also appears in your light dashboard. From there you can review the details, adjust the estimate, and follow up with the family.
