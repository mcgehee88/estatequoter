<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: November 23, 2025</small></p>

<p>
  EstateQuoter is owned and operated by Surplus Haven LLC (“EstateQuoter,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use
  <a href="https://estatequoter.com">estatequoter.com</a> (the “Site”) and our quote request services (the “Service”).
</p>

<h2>1. What we do</h2>
<p>
  EstateQuoter is an online intake tool that helps families, heirs, and executors connect with local
  estate liquidators, estate sale companies, and cleanout professionals. You provide details about a
  property and your needs, and we share that information with relevant local professionals so they can
  review the situation and provide quotes or follow-up questions.
</p>

<h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

<h3>Information you provide</h3>
<p>When you use the Site or submit a quote request, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contact details (name, email address, phone number).</li>
  <li>Property details (ZIP code, property type, approximate square footage, rooms, access details, timeline, notes).</li>
  <li>Details about items and services needed (fullness level, high-value items, clear-out needs, etc.).</li>
  <li>Optional content such as a video walk-through of the property.</li>
  <li>Any other information you choose to provide in free-text fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect:</p>

  <li>Referring URL and pages you visit on our Site.</li>
  <li>Date/time of visits and basic usage data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may use third-party tools and service providers (for example, IP geolocation services, analytics
  tools, and hosting providers) to help us collect or process this information.
</p>

<h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
<p>
  The Site may use cookies or similar technologies to help the Site function, remember your preferences,
  and understand how visitors use the Site. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies or

</ul>

<h2>4. How we share information</h2>

<h3>With estate professionals</h3>
<p>
  The core of our Service is sharing your quote request and relevant information with estate

  <li>Optional content such as a video walk-through, if you choose to upload and consent to sharing it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>With service providers</h3>
<p>
  We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who help us operate the Site and
  Service, such as hosting providers, form processing tools, email delivery tools, analytics providers,
  and workflow/automation tools. These providers are allowed to use your information only as needed to
  perform services on our behalf.
</p>

<h3>Business and legal reasons</h3>
<p>We may also share information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To comply with a legal obligation, court order, or lawful request.</li>
  <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of users or others.</li>
  <li>In connection with a business transaction (for example, a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets), subject to confidentiality protections where reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. How long we keep information</h2>
<p>
  We keep your information only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this
  policy, including providing the Service, maintaining records of quote activity, complying with legal
  obligations, and resolving disputes. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of data and
  applicable law.
